# US&LIM (User Signup & Login Improved)

- As you can probably guess, this is an improved version
  of the User System I created in Fortran like two days ago
  or something.

- This time I added logging into created accounts...
    - A better user deletion system...
    - You can see which account you are logged into...
    - I also showed the controls at the "bottom" of the screen.
        - To add onto that, you have to press enter after you enter in
          the key.
          - e
            - e
              - e

# Controls

Don't know why you'd need this, it literally shows the controls,
anyways.

- List -
    - [W] -> Up
    - [S] -> Down
    - [E] -> Execute a command
    - [Q] -> Kill the program

# How to run

If you wanna run this program for some weird reason, just go into the terminal,
and type "./main".

All of a sudden, you are running the US&LIM!

# Something to NOTE

- Like always, I "forgot" to comment my code, okay goodbye now.
